<h1>HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT THE CAUSE</h1>
<p class="Support">Obviously, our wourds mean nothing if you choose not to heed them. We encourage you to fight against these British trespassers by any means necessary. If a tax collector comes to your door, tar and feather him. Forcefully remove British soldiers from your town. Form militias to protect the innocents of your neighborhood. And last but most definitely not least, join the Continental Army and serve under your future king.</p>
