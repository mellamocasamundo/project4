<h1>WE ARE REBELS. WE ARE AMERICANS.</h1>
<p class="Identity">Hello, fellow human beings and individuals under God. Allow us to provide you with a proper and offical introduction. WE are Whigs. WE are Rebels. WE are Patriots. But perhaps most important, WE are Americans. We are fighting for a righteous and justifiable cause, which is self-determination for our great country and independence from the British Crown. Several events that have been engineered by British hands that wish to subdue us and strip the men of the 13 colonies of their essential human rights, have pushed we colonists to the limits and we now wish to call ourselves the free people of a free nation. After being oppressed by our past mother and present enemy, Great Britain, we wish to expel British rule from our country and we need YOUR help to do this. We would greatly appreciate if you would support the fight for freedom. In more simpler terms that with which Benjamin Franklin has gracefully bequethed us, Join or die.</p>
