  <h1>WHY WE FIGHT THE CROWN</h1>
  <p class="massacre"><b>Boston Massacre</b><br> The properly titled "Boston Massacre" occurred on the date of March 5, 1770. A group of British soldiers came to the aid of fellow regulars that were hastling a crowd that responding with jeers and the occasional snowball.
   It is assumed the regulars soon had enough of being resisted by "vicious" poor farmers and merchants. The Brits retaliated by releasing a volley of shots into the defenseless crowd of mothers, children, fathers and daughters. Three persons were killed
   immediately by the British bullets and two died later of their wounds The British officer in charge, Capt. Thomas Preston, was arrested for manslaughter, along with eight of his comrades; all were later acquitted of their crimes. We patriots remember
   the Boston Massacre as a key event in helping us galvanize the colonial public. The cowardly redcoats never even paid for their crimes, but we each remember the poor souls that perished in the name of freedom.</p>

	 <p class="intolerableacts"><b>Intolerable Acts</b><br> Intolerable Acts were four harsh laws that were in response in retaliation for acts of defensive maneuvers by the colonials. The reports of colonial "resistance" to unfair British law made the crooked politicians of Parliament more determined than ever to assert its authority in America. Most disciplinary action fell on Boston, which seemed to be the center of colonial movements against the Crown. Angered by the courageous acts of the Boston Tea Party, the British government passed a Bill that closed that city’s harbour indefinitely until restitution was made for the destroyed tea.  the Massachusetts Government Act removed the colony’s charter of 1691 and substituted a functioning government for a more primal military government. The bill went even so far to forbidding town meetings without approval. The Intolerable Acts represented a sad attempt to reimpose cruel British control over the American people. The oppressive measures they went so far to use became the justification for the forming of the First Continental Congress.
